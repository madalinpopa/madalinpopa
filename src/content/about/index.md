## About me

{{< floatImg name="madalin" alt="Madalin Popa" >}}

I'm a self-taught learner, with a great passion for learning and technology. I live in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, the place where I was born.

I got into IT when I was 14, and that's when I first found Linux. I fell in love with it instantly. Around the same time, I put together my first computer network and started learning more about it. I learned how to keep a network safe, set it up the right way, and fix any issues that came up. I loved it and spent a lot of time learning more.

Then I found out how much I could do with a simple bash script, and that got me interested in programming. I kept learning and started using C, Java and Python to understand more about how computers work. Later, I started to get into making web applications and learned more about JavaScript and different tools for building efficient applications. I'm really into everything about web applications. From front-end to back-end, I enjoy exploring how everything works and fits together. I like every part of making a web app. From the first idea to putting it out there for people to use, I enjoy seeing it all come together.

When I'm not engaged in technology-related activities, I enjoy spending my free time listening to music, reading books, and watching movies. When it's sunny out, I like to go on long walks and bike rides.

19 years after my first computer today, I believe more than ever in Steve Jobs' quote:

>Everybody in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches
>you how to think ”- Steve Jobs.
